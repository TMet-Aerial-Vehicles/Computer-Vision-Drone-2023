# Pushing to Github
Github has stopped letting us push changes to a repo using a simple password. There are many ways to do this but a very efficient way is to use SSH keys

These keys are first generated by your computer and then added to as an indentifier to your computer.
Next you need to register this key pair with Github so that you can push from your computer to your repo of choice.

SSH keys may or may not require a password. This is decided when you create the key.
Having a password on your SSH key is strongly encouraged as an SSH key gives direct unfiltered access to your Github account.

Once you have added the key, your dashboard should look like this.
